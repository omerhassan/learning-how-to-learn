 This repository contains a summary and personal notes of [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course. Instructored by [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) and [Dr. Terrence Sejnowski](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/).

## What motivates me?

- I taked this course just out of curiosity, I found there is a synergistic relationship between Neurosience and Artficial Intilligance (AI).

- AI researchers find that neuroscince as a useful guide in thier research for solutions to AI, also they used it as a validation method for what ideas that they are working on.

- As [Matt Botvinick](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/matthew-botvinick) (Director of Neuroscience Research, DeepMind) once said:

``` bash
It would have been silly for people trying to solve flight, to completley ignore birds,
And that's I think what we would be doing in AI research if we didn't attend to neuroscience.
```

<br/>

- So, in the same way we had it in AI/ML, researchers they try to solve `how we can learn?`
question, then the first thing that we want to understand how it works is our `Brain`, and this course will help us to understand the learning process in a good maner.

## Week 2: Chunking

_[Here's](google.com) the `slides` and a pdf of the `questions` and `answers` found in the videos_

### Introduction

- `Chunks` are `compact packages` of information that your mind can easily access.
- How you can form a chunk? how you can use it?
- Explore `illusions of competence` in learning.
- `Overlearning` and `Interleaving`.

### Chunking

#### What is a Chunk?

- Is the `mental leap` that helps you `unite bits` of information together through meaning.
- This will lets the chunk `easier to remember`.
- Helps to `fit` the chunks into the `larger PICs`.
- Chunking helps your brain run more `efficiently`. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you `don't need` to remember all the little underlying details.
