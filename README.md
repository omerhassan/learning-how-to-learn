## Preface

I take this course just out of ceruosity, I found there is a synergistic relationship between Neurosience and Artficial Intilligance (AI).

AI researchers find that neuroscince as a useful guide in thier research for solutions to AI, also they used it as a validation method for what ideas that they are working on.

As [Matt Botvinick](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/matthew-botvinick) (Director of Neuroscience Research, DeepMind) once said:

```bash
"It would have been silly for people trying to solve flight, to completley ignore birds,
And that's I think what we would be doing in AI research if we didn't attend to neuroscience."
```

<br/>

So, in the same way we had it in AI/ML, researchers they try to solve **how we can learn?**
question, then the first thing that we want to understand how it works is our **Brain**, and this course will help us to understand the learning process in a good maner.
