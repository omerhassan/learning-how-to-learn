## Preface

Going out for ceruosity, I find researchers when they try to solve a problem, the first things
that they come to do is to searching in the nature to find something can be slowley simmiler to
the same category of that problem.

For Ex. when they want to fly, they didn't trying to find a solution without understanding how
birds can fly, even if the new solution can be a different from what they obsarive from the
natural.

So, in the same way we had it in AI/ML, researchers they try to solve **how we can learn?**
question, then the first thing that we want to understand how it works is our **Brain**.

And Neuroscince and AI they can help each other to go beyound far away.

I took this course fow Two reason:

### Firstly

the first one is that, Knowing how to learn will move my skills
to the next level, By, knowing the standers a the techniques for the best guidelines for learn.

### Secondly

The second reason I find that their are strong relationship btw neuroscience and AI, I found AI researchers saw neuroscience as a useful guide in searching for solutions to AI.
