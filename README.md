## Preface

Going out for ceruosity, I find researchers when they try to solve a problem, the first things
that they come to do is to searching in the nature to find something can be slowley simmiler to
the same category of that problem.

For Ex. when they want to fly, they didn't trying to find a solution without understanding how 
birds can fly, even if the new solution can be a different from what they obsarive from the 
natural.

So, in the same way we had it in AI/ML, researchers they try to solve ***how we can learn?***
question, then the first thing that we want to understand how it works is our ***Brain***.

And Neuroscince and AI they can help each other to go beyound far away.
