## Preface

I take this course just out of curiosity, I found there is a synergistic relationship between Neurosience and Artficial Intilligance (AI).

AI researchers find that neuroscince as a useful guide in thier research for solutions to AI, also they used it as a validation method for what ideas that they are working on.

As [Matt Botvinick](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/matthew-botvinick) (Director of Neuroscience Research, DeepMind) once said:

```bash
"It would have been silly for people trying to solve flight, to completley ignore birds,

And that's I think what we would be doing in AI research if we didn't attend to neuroscience."
```

<br/>

So, in the same way we had it in AI/ML, researchers they try to solve **how we can learn?**
question, then the first thing that we want to understand how it works is our **Brain**, and this course will help us to understand the learning process in a good maner.

### Introduction

---

- `Chunks` are `compact packages` of information that your mind can easily access.
- How you can form a chunk? how you can use it?
- Explore `illusions of competence` in learning.
- `Overlearning` and `Interleaving`.

### Chunking

#### What is a Chunk?

- Is the `mental leap` that helps you `unite bits` of information together through meaning.
- This will lets the chunk `easier to remember`.
- Helps to `fit` the chunks into the `larger PICs`.
- Chunking helps your brain run more `efficiently`. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you
`don't need` to remember all the little underlying details.
